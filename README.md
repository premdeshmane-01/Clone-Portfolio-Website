Portfolio​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌ Website Clone: A Skill-Building Project

This repository represents my hands-on journey of consolidating the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript basics by cloning a professionally designed portfolio website.

💡 The Goal: Learn by Rebuilding

It was the crucial aim of the project not to do a mere copy of the website, but to deconstruct a live site and reconstruct it in a totally new way with my own logic and engineering decisions. The particular steps taken in the article aimed to:

Build Confidence: Use theoretical knowledge to create a real, functioning project.

Strengthen Fundamental Skills: Acquire practical skills through constructing HTML, CSS layouts (with modern techniques like Flexbox and Grid), and JavaScript for interaction.

Practice Efficiency: Consciously make code efficiency, maintainability, and responsiveness decisions—a vital "better engineer" skill. In acknowledging that there are many ways to reach the same result, I concentrated on choosing the most efficient and clean implementation for each component.

🛠️ Key Technologies & Learnings

HTML5: Use semantically correct tags for the content.

CSS3: Styling, layout implementation, and ensuring full responsiveness across various screen sizes.

JavaScript: The additions of interactivity, animation, and dynamic behavior.

🌟 Outcomes

This was an exercise of an intense, in-depth, real-world development challenge. By working through the issues of navigation menus, complex layouts, and interactive elements altogether, I have improved my problem-solving skills to a great extent and also deepened my knowledge of front-end ​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌architecture.
