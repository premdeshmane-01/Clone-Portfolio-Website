# Clone-Portfolio-Website
â€‹ðŸš€ Portfolio Clone Project â€‹Goal: Master HTML, CSS, &amp; JavaScript by replicating a professional portfolio site. I rebuilt it from scratch, focusing on efficient logic, clean code, and responsive design. This exercise was a confidence builder and a push to be a "better engineer" by choosing the most effective implementation for every component.
